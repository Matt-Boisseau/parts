= Parts

repair jobs come in every turn

they need x amount of various parts

every part requires a specific tool to apply it to the job (screwdriver for screws, hammer for nails, etc)

start with tools in your deck

get a new random tool for completing a job

get parts by pulling them out of the warehouse

tools don't get removed from your deck when used - parts do

always draw to x cards

if you have the right tool in your hand, you can play corresponding parts (which get replaced by new cards from your deck?)

at any time, you can end the turn - new job comes in, draw a fresh hand, new parts shipments appear randomly

grabbing parts you don't want is bad, because it will saturate your deck with garbage
